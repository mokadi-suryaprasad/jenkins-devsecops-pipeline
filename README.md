# DevSecOps CI/CD Pipeline

## Overview
This project is a **DevSecOps CI/CD pipeline** that automates building, testing, security scanning, and deploying applications using **Jenkins, Docker, SonarQube, Trivy, and ArgoCD**. It ensures a secure and efficient software delivery process.

## How It Works
The pipeline follows a step-by-step process:

1. **Code Commit:** Developers push their code to a Git repository (GitHub/GitLab).
2. **Unit Testing:** Runs tests to check if the code works properly.
3. **Static Code Analysis:** Uses SonarQube to analyze the code quality.
4. **Build Application:** Compiles and builds the application using NPM or Go.
5. **Docker Image Creation:** Builds a Docker image of the application.
6. **Security Scanning:** Uses Trivy to scan for vulnerabilities in the Docker image.
7. **Push to Docker Hub:** If the scan is successful, the image is pushed to Docker Hub.
8. **Update Image Tag:** Updates the deployment file with the new image version.
9. **Deploy to Kubernetes:** Uses ArgoCD to deploy the application to Kubernetes.
10. **Monitoring & Notifications:** Sends notifications about the pipeline status (success or failure).

## Technologies Used
- **Jenkins** - Automates CI/CD pipeline execution
- **GitHub/GitLab** - Version control system
- **SonarQube** - Code quality analysis
- **Trivy** - Security scanning for vulnerabilities
- **Docker** - Containerization
- **Kubernetes (K8s)** - Container orchestration
- **ArgoCD** - Kubernetes deployment automation

## How to Set Up the Pipeline

### 1. Clone the Repository
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/devsecops-pipeline.git
cd devsecops-pipeline
```

### 2. Configure Jenkins
- Install Jenkins and required plugins.
- Add a **Jenkins Shared Library** for reusable pipeline functions.
- Configure **SonarQube** and **Trivy** in Jenkins.

### 3. Connect Jenkins to GitHub/GitLab
- Add a webhook to trigger the pipeline on code changes.

### 4. Run the Pipeline
- Create a **Jenkinsfile** in your project.
- Run the Jenkins job to start the CI/CD process.

### 5. Verify Deployment
- Check ArgoCD to see the deployed application in Kubernetes.
- Monitor logs and test the running application.
